* NodeJS >= `12.19.0 LTS`

## How to run?
1. `git clone https://github.com/muety/mininote`
2. In root directory: `yarn`
3. And again in _webapp_ directory: `yarn`
4. Adapt `config.js` to your needs (e.g. set web server port)
5. In _webapp_ directory: `yarn build`
6. In root directory: `yarn start`

## How to run with Docker?
1. `git clone https://github.com/muety/mininote`
2. `docker build -t mininote .`
3. `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /your-dir-of-choice:/app/data mininote`
--> MiniNote will listen on port 3000 and persist data to `/your-dir-of-choice` on your host system using a shared volume.

## Use HTTPS for backend
1. Open `config.js`
2. Edit the `HTTPS_KEY` and `HTTPS_CERT` field, and insert the file locations at which your private key and site certifications are stored.
3. Launch the backend server
--> To switch back to the HTTP server, nullify either field and relaunch again.

## Todo
