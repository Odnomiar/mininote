A simple, self-hosted, encrypted Markdown note-taking app built with [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org), and [Express](http://expressjs.com). Check out the **[hosted demo](https://apps.muetsch.io/mininote)**!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
With the release of version `1.0.0`, **encryption** was introduced. However, due to this non-trivial change, this release is not backwards-compatible with previous versions. Attempting to run version `1.0.0` with a database created with an earlier version will cause the application to crash. 

Currently, no automated migration is provided, sorry. To migrate to `1.0.0`, you will need to run two parallel instances and manually copy your notes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
* NodeJS >= `12.19.0 LTS`

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to run?
```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/muety/mininote

# Install backend dependencies
$ yarn

# Install frontend dependencies and build
$ cd webapp && yarn && yarn build && cd ..

# Run
$ yarn start
```

### Use HTTPS for backend
1. Open `config.js`
2. Edit the `HTTPS_KEY` and `HTTPS_CERT` field, and insert the file locations at which your private key and site certifications are stored.
3. Launch the backend server
-> To switch back to the HTTP server, nullify either field and relaunch again.

## üê≥ How to run with Docker?
```bash
# Create a persistent volume
$ docker volume create mininote-data

# Run the container
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v mininote-data:/app/data --name mininote n1try/mininote
```

## üîí Encryption
MiniNote features encryption, i.e. every note's title and content are encrypted on the client-side (i.e. in your browser) using symmetric AES-GCM provided by the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). However, a notebook's password is used to derive the encryption key. That is, encryption is [only as strong as your password](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/42538/is-password-based-aes-encryption-secure-at-all). Moreover, although notes are sent to the server encryptedly, this cannot be considered _true_ end-to-end encryption, since the server technically has a chance to log your password the moment you create a new notebook in the first place. MiniNote aims for a decent level of security, but does not claim to be NSA-proof.
